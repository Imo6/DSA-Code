1) A person shoots his wife. Then holds her under water for 5 minutes. Finally, he hangs her. But after 10 minutes they both go out together and enjoy a wonderful dinner together. How can this be?

The answer: 1

The woman was a photographer. She shot a picture of her husband, developed it, and hung it up to dry.
